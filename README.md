# PHSX815_Week9_2D_Minimization: How to use the code

Download '2d_Minimization.py'. Run it using 'python "/path/2d_Minimization.py"' on the command line.
The user obtains 3 plots: A 2D plot of the function, a 3D plot of the function and a 2D plot of the function with the position of the minimum shown.
In the code for 2D minimization, the parameters are x[0] and x[1]. The function f(x) is taken to be sin(x[0]) * cos(x[1]) in this example. The output of the code also generates the result of the minimization and gives the position of the minimum of the 2D function. If you wish to save the output in a text file, run the command './path/2d_Minimization.py > out.txt'. This creates a text file called 'out.txt' in the directory and and saves the output in the file (an example of which is uploaded to the repository.
